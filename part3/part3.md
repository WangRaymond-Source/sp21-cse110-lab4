## Part 3. Debugging using the DevTools
1. The bug was that the data type on num1 and num2 was incorrect. num1 and num2 were treated like strings; therefore, we got the concatenation of num1 and num2. Overall, it was not calculating the sum, but instead it concatenated num1 and num2.
2. To fix this bug I would have to convert num1 and num2 into numbers then it would fix the bug. The results would be the sum of num1 and num2.
