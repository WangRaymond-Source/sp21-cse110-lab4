## part 1a
1. values added: 20 
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error because the "result" cannot be access at line 13 as "result" has a let keyword which means that "result" in the code can only be access within the if statement block that it is declared in.
5. Error because result is declared with const which means it cannot be reassign which is what we try to do in line 9.
6. Error because const has the similar effects as the let keyword which means result at line 13 cannot be access as it is not with the block at which result was declared.
## part 1b
1. At line 12 it will print out 3 because i is a var, it can be accessed everywhere in the function and the loop will stop running when i hits 3 which is the length prices given.
2. At line 13 it will print out 150 because discountedPrice will update one last time when it hits 300 in the list. Since discountedPrice is a var it will contain the latest updated value, in this case it is 150 and the variable can be accessed everywhere in the function.
3. At line 14 it will print out 150 because finalPrice is a var, it can be accessed anywhere in the function and it can be reassigned. When it is reassigned in the for loop, it will contain 150.
4. It will return the discounted list [50,100,150]. This function will return an updated list of new prices that are discounted because the for loop the function will run the given prices list and apply the discount to them and append the new prices to a new list and then return that new list.Since discounted is a var it can be accessed everywhere in the function, it is able to be returned.
5. The code will cause an Error as i is a let and it can only be access within the for loop block.
6. The code will cause an Error as discountedPrice is a let and it can only be access within the for loop block.
7. At line 14 it will print out 150 because finalPrice is a let and it is defined in the function where it can be accessed everywhere in the function. When it is reassigned in the for loop, it will contain 150.
8. It will return the discounted list [50,100,150]. This function will return an updated list of new prices that are discounted because the for loop the function will run the given prices list and apply the discount to them and append the new prices to a new list and then return that new list. Since discounted is a let which is defined within the function where it can be accessed everywhere in the function, it is able to be returned.
